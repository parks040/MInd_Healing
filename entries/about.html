    <h1 class="title">Healing Emotions through Comforting Words and Art: A Website Dedicated to Positivity and Emotional Well-being</h1>
    <p class="description">
        The decisive factors that differentiate humans from animals are the ability to think and the rich emotions that humans possess at birth. The ability to think and rich emotions are essential in leading and developing our society in the right direction, but excessive thinking and emotions can lead to negative thoughts. People are more drawn to and sensitive to negative emotions such as irritation, depression, difficulty, loneliness, jealousy, fear, and anger than positive expressions such as happiness, and love. I also was in a period when I could not escape negative emotions. When I felt this way, I  appreciated Claude Monet’s artworks, read self-improvement books, or drew the scenery outside with pastel colored pencils to capture my current emotions. These actions helped me heal my mind and distance myself from negative emotions. I wanted to create a website that serves as a cozy shelter for those who struggle with negative emotions to heal their minds. So, I came up with the idea of including quotes that arouse positiveness and reinterpretations of these quotes in my artwork. There are many ways to heal emotional wounds, but I believe that a comforting word is the most effective. My website not only delivers comforting words to people but also includes visual artwork that visualizes these comforting words, making it even more helpful for emotional healing.
