    <h1 class="title">The Value of Human Existence and the Power of Reflection</h1>
    <p class="description">The Earth, born from the Big Bang, is home to countless life forms, each living their day-to-day lives towards their dreams and goals. What is the reason for human existence? What keeps them alive? Is there enough value in human existence? The universe is constantly expanding, and it will eventually surpass the speed of light, 300,000 kilometers. This will create a realm beyond our observation. Could there be multiple universes? Are humans living in our universe, which is just a part of countless universes, valuable? Humans are not phoenixes; they will eventually reach the end of their lives and disappear from this world. What purpose do humans born under such unfavorable conditions serve? Despite this, most people are living their days with all their might. What keeps them alive? What makes them brave? While pondering these endless questions, I also thought about the value of my own existence. I believe that my value is something I create for myself. I write in my diary to give meaning to my existence. As I record my life in my diary notebook, I believe that before my life ends, I will be able to reflect on my memories and recognize my value. Recording each day makes me live diligently and feel that I am alive in this world. It also instills the idea that the main character in this diary is myself, and the main character of my life is also myself. Why don't you try writing a diary? Cheer up today!
