    <h1 class="title">Doubt the Voice of the World, Create Time for Yourself, and Embark on a Journey of Inner Discovery</h1>
    <p class="description">
        First, you must doubt the voice of the world.

        The world's voice can often lead us astray, causing confusion and distortion in our lives.
        
        Second, you must create time for yourself.
        
        In a busy world, it is crucial to carve out time to reflect on your inner self.
        
        Third, use the time you have left to spend time on your inner self.
        
        Through inner time, you can organize your thoughts and emotions and look back on your life.
        
        Fourth, once your mind has calmed, experience moments of silence where you do not even talk to yourself in deep stillness.
        
        Silent moments bring peace to your mind and deepen your understanding of yourself.
        
        Fifth, after many days and enough time to become accustomed to calming your mind, now it's time to move forward into reality.
        
        As you move forward, you can enrich your life and achieve your dreams.
        
        Sixth, you need to plan.
        
        Consider the day when your life will end and create a macroscopic plan for the rest of your life.
        
        Seventh, you must navigate the path of enlightenment that you have planned.
        
        Only then will you truly understand the reality of the world being your mind when you reach the end.
