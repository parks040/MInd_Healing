    <p class="description">Humans form and grow their identities through relationships. Everything in this world exists through interaction, and humans can understand, care for, and judge what is right and wrong through interaction.

        If there were only me on Earth, humans could not survive. Humans are social animals, so it is essential to live with others. It is important to communicate, cooperate, respect, and care for each other's opinions with others.
        
        Humans strive to achieve their dreams and goals, but in the process, they cannot ignore the gaze of others. The gaze of others affects our lives, and we must pursue happiness with others.
        
        Therefore, we must cherish not only ourselves but also the people around us. Communicating, cooperating, respecting, and caring for each other's opinions with close people around us is an important element for a happy life.</p>
