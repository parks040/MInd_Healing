    <p class="description">Do you want to be happy? It's really simple. I've never seen anything easier. If you decide to be happy, you can be happier than anyone else. Look around you. Everything around you right now can make you happy. You just don't know this fact. The fan in front of you right now can cast a spell to completely erase your irritation caused by the heat, the books on your desk can give you a ticket to travel to a wonderful place, and the blanket can give you warmth.

        Looking back on the past years, I was always lacking energy. To be more precise, I was running and running in a maze that seemed endless. Home, school, library... home, school, library... I was exhausted and I couldn't see an exit on any of the paths. I sat down and spent time looking at the air without doing anything. I was not happy.
        
        "How can you be happy in this infinite maze? How can you find happiness in this infinite maze where there is no exit? The fan is just an object that is supposed to cool my heat, the book is just for my entertainment, and the blanket is just a cloth to cover myself when it's cold. Don't talk nonsense. How can these insignificant things make me happy? I will just live looking at the air like this." The past me shouted at the present me with an irritated tone.
        
        However, when I felt negative thoughts like that, I tried to console myself by saying that I could be happy and that the degree of happiness depends on how much I decide to be happy. If I thought I couldn't be happy, I would never be happy. Then, I saw that everything around me was filled with things that could make me happy, and the world looked different.</p>
