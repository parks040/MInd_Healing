    <h1 class="title">Memoir: I remember</h1>
    <p class="description">As soon as I graduated from elementary school, I lived in an unfamiliar land, America, for two years. Being surrounded by people of different races and cultures felt so lonely and frustrating as if a corner of my heart was blocked. I made a lot of effort to follow their cultures and thoughts. I could tell that I had no time to find my ego identity. I was so busy finding out how they communicated and what they liked that I didn’t have time to find out what I liked and what my ‘true self ‘ was. After spending two lonely and immature years and completing the entrance exam to Seoul Arts High School, I finally entered Seoul Arts High School at the age of 17. I faced tangled and disorganized relationships, depression, and phobias during high school. After school, I always went to the library to study, and when I came home, what I was faced with was a room with darkness and hollowness. When I think about it now, I wonder how I survived back then. To be honest, I couldn’t bear it. At that time, I was dying. I was so lonely, but the only thing that benefited me from living alone was having time to deeply understand myself.  I learn a lot about myself. I learned what I like, what I dislike, my values, the direction I pursue, and my life plan for the future.

        After graduating from high school, I had to fully live in the United States. My whole family immigrated to Virginia to live in December. I also moved to Virginia in December, and all of my friends were not done with their college applications and neither was I. After I turned my portfolios to colleges, I felt the futility of life. I spent most of the time in the room doing nothing. Where I live in Virginia, there isn’t much to see around like New York or Seoul. Not only did I have no friends in Virginia, but I also had nothing to go out and do. When I think about it now, I feel like I have wasted so much time during that moment. I should have read books or written a diary. I should have done something and moved my body so that I could concentrate on the present, not the future or past. I think time passes quickly in some ways and slowly in others. I learned a lesson that time is precious to each of us.
        
        I started to plan a trip to Paris. I thought I could heal myself from being emotional and negative. During my trip to Paris, I encountered beautiful landscapes and buildings. Walking over the bridge, running down the street when it’s raining, eating a baguette with butter in a cafe, having a conversation with my sister about what we have done that day during the trip before I go to bed, and doing makeup early in the morning to take pictures made me understand what happiness is. I can also remember that I was fascinated by an impressionist artist called Claude Monet in the Art Museum. His artworks impacted my art style by using pastel tones. When I appreciated his artworks, I felt comfortable and safe, and I also felt that pastel tones sympathetically touched my bruised feelings. After I came back to my house, I painted several different paintings using pastel tones because I wanted to feel that feeling in the Art Museum again. For sure, I could feel that feeling while I was painting, and it helped me to get away from the negative side of me.
